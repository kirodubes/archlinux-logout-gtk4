## Overview

ArchLinux Logout is a power management utility designed for desktop environments and window managers that need a unified way to access logout, shutdown, reboot, suspend, hibernate, and lock functionality. The application displays a beautiful, semi-transparent window with large, easy-to-click icons and optional labels for each action.

## Dependencies

This application requires the following packages:

```bash
depends=('python-psutil' 'libwnck3' 'python-cairo' 'betterlockscreen' 'python-distro')
```

### Dependency Details

- **python-psutil**: For system monitoring and process handling
- **libwnck3**: Window manager utilities for detecting desktop environment
- **python-cairo**: Graphics rendering library for custom drawings
- **betterlockscreen**: Advanced lockscreen functionality with blur effects
- **python-distro**: For detecting the Linux distribution and session type

## Features

### Power Management Actions

The application provides quick access to the following power management features via buttons and keyboard shortcuts:

- **Logout (L)** - Exit the current desktop session
- **Reboot/Restart (R)** - Restart the system
- **Shutdown (S)** - Power off the system
- **Suspend (U)** - Put the system into sleep mode
- **Hibernate (H)** - Save system state to disk and power off
- **Lock (K)** - Lock the current session

### Customization Options

ArchLinux Logout offers extensive configuration options to personalize the appearance and behavior:

- **Widget Opacity**: Control the transparency level of the overlay (0-100%)
- **Icon Size**: Adjust the size of action icons to suit your preferences (defaults to 80px)
- **Font Size**: Customize the size of action labels
- **Theme Selection**: Choose from multiple built-in themes to match your desktop aesthetic
- **Button Visibility**: Show or hide specific power management buttons
- **Text Labels**: Toggle whether action labels are displayed alongside icons

## Configuration

### Config Location

Configuration is stored in: `~/.config/archlinux-logout/archlinux-logout.conf`

On first run, the default configuration is automatically copied from `/etc/archlinux-logout.conf`.

### Configuration File Format

The config file uses INI-style format with the following sections:

```bash
[settings]
opacity=80
icon_size=80
font_size=11
theme=handy
show_text=False
buttons=cancel,shutdown,restart,suspend,hibernate,lock,logout

[commands]
lock=betterlockscreen -l dim -- --time-str="%H:%M"
shutdown=systemctl poweroff
restart=systemctl reboot
suspend=systemctl suspend
hibernate=systemctl hibernate

[binds]
lock=K
restart=R
shutdown=S
suspend=U
hibernate=H
logout=L
cancel=Escape
settings=P

[themes]
theme=handy
```

### Display Detection

The application automatically detects:

- **Session Type**: Distinguishes between Wayland and X11 sessions
- **Monitor Layout**: On X11, uses xdotool to detect mouse position and display the logout menu on the correct monitor
- **Desktop Environment**: Automatically selects appropriate logout commands for different DEs and window managers



## Keyboard Shortcuts

All power management actions and settings can be accessed via keyboard:

- **S** - Shutdown
- **R** - Restart/Reboot
- **U** - Suspend
- **H** - Hibernate

- Select a theme
- Toggle text labels
- Enable/disable specific buttons
- Save your preferences

```

### Running from Source

```bash
python3 usr/share/archlinux-logout/archlinux-logout.py
```

## Troubleshooting

### Config File Corruption

If the configuration file becomes corrupted, it will be automatically detected and reset to defaults.

### Permission Issues

The application requires appropriate permissions to execute power management commands. On systems using systemd, ensure your user is in the appropriate groups:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG wheel $USER
```

### Monitor Detection

If the logout menu appears on the wrong monitor:
- Ensure `xdotool` is installed for X11 session support
- On Wayland, the menu will always appear on the primary monitor
